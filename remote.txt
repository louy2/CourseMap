Figured I'd post this in case anyone else is still having trouble keeping their forks up to date

HOW TO KEEP YOUR FORK UPDATED

-Open CourseMap locally in GitHub using Git Shell

-type the following: git remote add upstream https://github.com/louy2/coursemap
	this will add a remote called upstream, which will go to youfan's coursemap

-type the following: git fetch upstream
	this will fetch all of the branches of youfan's (our master)
	
-type the following: checkout master
	this will give you the master branch
	
-type the following: git rebase upstream/master
	this will rewrite YOUR master branch so your commits will be replayed at the top
